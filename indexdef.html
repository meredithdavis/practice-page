<h2>Define Dubstep</h2>
<p>Please see the evidence.</p><blockquote><p> Bass is the best. <br /> Bass is the best. <br /> Bass is the best. </p></blockquote>
<p><abbr title="Da Best"> Dubstep</abbr> has the best unpredictable predictabe elements. See list below, but the <acronym title="Global Association of Dubsetp Awesomeness">
GADA</acronym> says all of this is <em>true</em> so you better believe it too.</p>
<p>Okay okay, here are some examples: <a href="http://www.spin.com/2012/07/30-greatest-dubstep-songs-all-time/" target="_blank">Click for Dub Dub</a></p>
<p>That <cite>Spin </cite> article is not the greatest. It seems critics have a hard time accurately grasping the <dfn>dub cepts</dfn> or things
that make dubstep, well <em> dubstep</em></p>
<p>Origianally dubstep was <del> not the best</del> underrated and not played widely. But that <ins>changed</ins> over the years because people 
realized it was the best and then played it a lot.</p>
