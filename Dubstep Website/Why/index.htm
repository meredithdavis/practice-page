<dt>Drop</dt>
<dd>After the bass cuts out momentarily leaving you hanging on the edge of the last note and some <br />swishy airy effects, the bass 
comes charging back in full force with as much or (hopefully) more <br />energy as were it was left off. Usually the crowd simultaneously
knocks their head forward and <br />buckles their knees in pseudo drop style. When done in sync with the whole crowd, feelings of <br />group
euphoria have been known to occur sans drugs.</dd>
<dt>Bass</dt>
<dd> The loud thump and bum sounds that resonate in your chest and make you "feel" the music. </dd>
